# Backend Challenges

- Pick any one, or multiple, but definitely explore all of them and do whichever you fancy.
- Do note, the harder ones allow you to really display your creativity and may have less competition, whereas the easier ones may have more competition and much smaller scope to display your skills and creativity.
- Once again, if you want you can submit multiple solutions to multiple challenges.
- If you’re good at JavaScript (especially Promises and Streams), do **Stream Transformer** or **Event Syncer** to best display your skills. Even partial solutions are a very good display of your skills.
- If you’re good at logic and/or node built-in libraries, do **Color Picker Pentagon**, **Custom Serializer**, or **Man-In-The-Middle**.
